# Game Of Life

The Conway's Game of Life built with LibGdx

## What it is the Game of Life?

Is a cellular automaton invented by John Horton Conway in 1970. Consist in a simple grid with cells than change state based in the 
next rules.-
 
-Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.           
-Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.          
-Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.             
-Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.          

With this simple rules we can get awesome patterns and results after some steps.
