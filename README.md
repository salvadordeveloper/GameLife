Is a cellular automaton invented by John Horton Conway in 1970. Consist in a simple grid with cells than change state based in the 
next rules.-

-Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
-Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
-Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
-Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
